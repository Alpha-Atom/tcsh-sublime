tcsh-sublime
============
This package adds basic, no-frills highlighting for Cshell scripts.

Cshell is meant to be read and not written. The built-in "generic" shell highlighting does not always cut it for C-shell. My goal is sanity. I have tried to make it perform reasonable syntax highlighting, but I include no snippets or other fancy features.
